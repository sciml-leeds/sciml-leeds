Below is an overview seminars organised by the SciML community. We aim to put
recordings of each seminar online within a week of the seminar taking place.

[Please get in touch <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>](mailto://{{site.contact_email}}) if you'd like to come to
talk to us, we're a very diverse group in terms of applications in scientific
machine learning and would <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> to hear about your work!
